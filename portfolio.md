# `Jesse's Portfolio`

<span style="font-size:larger;">**H**</span>ello, my name is Jesse Passeri and Iâ€™m an aspiring computer science student, ready to learn and retain vast amounts of coding knowledge and history. First off, I always had a knack for computers when growing up. When my family purchased a Gateway back in 1998, I was always busy on that computer, forever wondering how computers communicate back and forth. It took me over 15 years to come to the realization that I want to study, and then master computers, specifically computer coding languages.
